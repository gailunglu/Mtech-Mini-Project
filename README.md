# Title - Eye-Controlled Mouse Using Mediapipe and OpenCV

# Project Overview
This project presents an innovative eye-controlled mouse system that enhances human-computer interaction using computer vision. Built with OpenCV and MediaPipe's FaceMesh, the system detects and tracks eye movements to control the cursor on screen. A blinking mechanism is also implemented to simulate mouse clicks. This solution offers a hands-free interface that can be especially beneficial for individuals with physical disabilities, promoting accessibility and inclusive technology.

# Background & Motivation
Human-computer interaction has evolved with technologies like gesture and voice recognition. Traditional eye-tracking systems often rely on infrared sensors or specialized hardware. However, recent advancements in machine learning and computer vision—particularly tools like MediaPipe—have enabled real-time eye tracking using just a webcam. Studies have shown that such systems can be powerful tools for users with motor impairments, providing new ways to interact with digital environments without the need for physical input devices.
